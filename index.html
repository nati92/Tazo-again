						<h3>The Tazo Difference</h3>	
				<p><font face="avenir" size="2">
			     <p>Tea is one of life’s simple pleasures. <br>
			     We begin with the world’s finest tea leaves, <br>
			     then artfully blend them with herbs, <br>
			     spices and botanicals to create unexpectedly rich, <br>
			     truly memorable flavor experiences.</p>

						<h3>Finest Ingredients</h3>
		
		<p><font face="avenir"> <font size="2">
                <p>Tazo tea buyers take regular trips to origin countries <br>
                to taste and select the finest-quality tea and botanicals available.<br>
                 Unlike other large tea companies that use pre-blended teas sourced at origin, <br>
                 Tazo buys only unblended teas. This allows us to acquire tea at its peak <br>
                 of freshness and to exercise greater control over the quality of the final blend.</p>
