						<h3>The Tazo Difference</h3>	
				<p><font face="avenir" size="2">
			     <p>Tea is one of life’s simple pleasures. <br>
			     We begin with the world’s finest tea leaves, <br>
			     then artfully blend them with herbs, <br>
			     spices and botanicals to create unexpectedly rich, <br>
			     truly memorable flavor experiences.</p>
		</font></p>
				
		
			
						<h3>Finest Ingredients</h3>
		
		<p><font face="avenir"> <font size="2">
                <p>Tazo tea buyers take regular trips to origin countries <br>
                to taste and select the finest-quality tea and botanicals available.<br>
                 Unlike other large tea companies that use pre-blended teas sourced at origin, <br>
                 Tazo buys only unblended teas. This allows us to acquire tea at its peak <br>
                 of freshness and to exercise greater control over the quality of the final blend.</p>
                 </p></font>
		
			
						<h3>Tazo Quality</h3>
		
		<p><font face="avenir"> <font size="2">
				When it comes to selecting the best-tasting teas, we listen to the leaves.<br>
				Once a tea is plucked and processed, freshness and quality are preserved <br>
				by ensuring that all teas and ingredients are properly stored and handled, <br>
 				and by selling only tea from the current or most recent growing season.<br>
				To maintain quality standards, every tea we use is tasted up to seven times <br>
  				before it reaches the consumer: at offer, before shipment, upon arrival,<br>
				during formulation, several times during blending and after packing.<br>
				Though we may taste more than 150 teas in a day, only a handful<br>
 				will ever find their way into a Tazo product.</p>
